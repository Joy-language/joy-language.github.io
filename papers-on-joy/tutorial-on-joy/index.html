    <br data-v-c6d54eee> This revision includes references to John Cowan's (2001) extension.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee><em data-v-c6d54eee>Abstract:</em> Joy is a functional programming language which is not based
    on the application of functions to arguments but on the composition of functions.
    It does not use lambda-abstraction of expressions but instead it uses quotation
    of expressions. A large number of what are called combinators are used to perform
    dequotation, they have the effect of higher order functions. Several of them
    can be used to eliminate recursive definitions. Programs in Joy are compact
    and often look just like postfix notation. Writing programs and reasoning about
    them is made easy because there is no substitution of actual for formal parameters.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    This tutorial describes basic features of the language Joy which are likely to be
    the same in all implementations.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee><em data-v-c6d54eee>Keywords:</em> functional programming, higher order functions, composition
    of functions, combinators, elimination of recursive definitions, variable free
    notation
  <hr data-v-c6d54eee><h2 data-v-c6d54eee>Introduction</h2>
  Although the theory of Joy is of interest, this tutorial exposition avoids theory
  as much as possible.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: This introductory section continues
    with a very short outline of some distinguishing features of the language.
    The next two sections introduce the basic data types and operations on them.
    The section after that returns to the central feature of Joy: quotations of
    programs and their use with combinators. After a short section on definitions
    the next section resumes the discussion of combinators, in particular those
    that can eliminate the need for recursive definitions. In the final section
    several short programs and one larger program are used to illustrate programming
    with aggregates in Joy.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    To add two integers, say 2 and 3, and to write their sum, you type the program
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          2  3  +
  </pre>
  This is ordinary postfix notation, a reverse form of a notation first
  used by Polish logicians in the 1920s. Its advantage is that in complex expressions
  no parentheses are needed. Internally it works like this: the first numeral causes
  the integer 2 to be pushed onto a stack. The second numeral causes the integer
  3 to be pushed on top of that. Then the addition operator pops the two integers
  off the stack and pushes their sum, 5. The system reads inputs like the above
  and executes them when they are terminated by a period <code data-v-c6d54eee>"."</code>, like
  this:
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          2  3  + .
  </pre>
  In the default mode there is no need for an explicit output instruction,
  so the numeral <code data-v-c6d54eee>5</code> is now written to the output file which normally
  is the screen. So, in the default mode the terminating <code data-v-c6d54eee>"."</code> may be
  taken to be an instruction to write the top element of the stack. In what follows
  the terminating period will not be shown any further.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Apart from integers, the current version of Joy as extended by John Cowan has real
    numbers or "floats". Arithmetic operations on floats are just like those on
    integers. The following multiplies two numbers
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          2.34  5.67  *
  </pre>
  and leaves their product, <code data-v-c6d54eee>13.2678</code>, on top of the stack. (So,
  to see the result on the terminal, the above line has to terminated by a period.)
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    To compute the square of an integer, it has to be multiplied by itself. To compute
    the square of the sum of two integers, the sum has to be multiplied by itself.
    Preferably this should be done without computing the sum twice. The following
    is a program to compute the square of the sum of 2 and 3:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          2  3  +  dup  *
  </pre>
  After the sum of 2 and 3 has been computed, the stack just contains the
  integer 5. The <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>dup</kbd> operator then pushes another copy of the 5 onto
  the stack. Then the multiplication operator replaces the two integers by their
  product, which is the square of 5. The square is then written out as 25. Apart
  from the <code data-v-c6d54eee>dup</code> operator there are several others for re-arranging
  the top of the stack. The <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>pop</kbd> operator removes the top element, and
  the
  <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>swap</kbd> operator interchanges the top two elements. This is quite different
  from proper postfix notation, because the stack manipulators only make sense
  in the presence of a stack. Such notation is also used in some pocket calculators,
  the Unix utility dc, the typesetting language Postscript and the general purpose
  language Forth. Billy Tanksley has suggested that this be called concatenative
  notation. The theory of this notation is a topic unto itself, but it will not
  be dealt with in this tutorial.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    A <em data-v-c6d54eee>list</em> of integers is written inside square brackets. Just as integers
    can be added and otherwise manipulated, so lists can be manipulated in various
    ways. The following <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>concat</kbd>-enates two lists:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [1 2 3]  [4 5 6 7]  concat
  </pre>
  The two lists are first pushed onto the stack. Then the
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>concat</code> operator pops them off the stack and pushes the list <code data-v-c6d54eee>[1 2 3 4 5 6 7]</code>    onto the stack. There it may be further manipulated or it may be written to the
  output file.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    The elements of a list need not be all of the same type, and the elements can be
    lists themselves. The following uses a list containing one integer, two floats
    and one list of three integers.
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [ 3.14  42  [1 2 3]  0.003 ]   dup  concat
  </pre>
  The <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>dup</kbd> operator will push a copy of the list on top of the
  stack, where the two lists will then be concatenated into one.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Joy makes extensive use of <em data-v-c6d54eee>combinator</em>s. These are like operators in
    that they expect something specific on top of the stack. But unlike operators
    they execute what they find on top of the stack, and this has to be the <em data-v-c6d54eee>quotation</em>      of a program, enclosed in square brackets. One of these is a combinator for
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>map</kbd>ping elements of one list via a function to another list. Consider
    the program
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [1 2 3 4]  [dup *]  map
  </pre>
  It first pushes the list of integers and then the quoted program onto
  the stack. The <code data-v-c6d54eee>map</code> combinator then removes the list and the quotation
  and constructs another list by applying the program to each member of the given
  list. The result is the list <code data-v-c6d54eee>[1 4 9
  16]</code> which is left on top of the stack.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    In <em data-v-c6d54eee>definition</em>s of new functions no formal parameters are used, and
    hence there is no substitution of actual parameters for formal parameters.
    After the following definition
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          square   ==   dup  *
  </pre>
  the symbol <code data-v-c6d54eee>square</code> can be used in place of <code data-v-c6d54eee> dup *
  </code>.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Definitions occur in blocks such as the following:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
      DEFINE
          square  ==  dup * ;
    cube    ==  dup dup * * .
  </pre>
  As the example shows, definition mode is initiated by the reserved word
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>DEFINE</code> and extends to the period. Individual definitions are separated
  by semicolons. In libraries the initiator
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>LIBRA</code> is used instead of
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>DEFINE</code>. In the remainder of this paper the initiator, the separator
  and the terminator will generally not be shown any further.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    As in other programming languages, definitions may be recursive, for example in the
    definition of the factorial function. That definition uses a certain recursive
    pattern that is useful elsewhere. In Joy there is a combinator for <em data-v-c6d54eee>primitive recursion</em>      which has this pattern built in and thus avoids the need for a definition.
    The
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>primrec</kbd> combinator expects two quoted programs in addition to a
    data parameter. For an integer data parameter it works like this: If the data
    parameter is zero, then the first quotation has to produce the value to be
    returned. If the data parameter is positive then the second has to combine
    the data parameter with the result of applying the function to its predecessor.
    For the factorial function the required quoted programs are very simple:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [1]  [*]  primrec
  </pre>
  computes the factorial recursively. There is no need for any definition.
  For example, the following program computes the factorial of
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>5</code>:
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          5  [1]  [*]  primrec
  </pre>
  It first pushes the number <code data-v-c6d54eee>5</code> and then it pushes the two short
  quoted programs. At this point the stack contains three elements. Then the <code data-v-c6d54eee>primrec</code>    combinator is executed. It pops the two quotations off the stack and saves them
  elsewhere. Then
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>primrec</code> tests whether the top element on the stack (initially the
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>5</code>) is equal to zero. If it is, it pops it off and executes one of
  the quotations, the <code data-v-c6d54eee>[1]</code> which leaves <code data-v-c6d54eee>1</code> on the stack
  as the result. Otherwise it pushes a decremented copy of the top element and
  recurses. On the way back from the recursion it uses the other quotation, <code data-v-c6d54eee>[*]</code>,
  to multiply what is now a factorial on top of the stack by the second element
  on the stack. When all is done, the stack contains
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>120</code>, the factorial of <code data-v-c6d54eee>5</code>.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    As may be seen from this program, the usual branching of recursive definitions is
    built into the combinator. The
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>primrec</code> combinator can be used with many other quotation parameters
    to compute quite different functions. It can also be used with data types other
    than integers.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Joy has many more combinators which can be used to calculate many functions without
    forcing the user to give recursive or non-recursive definitions. Some of the
    combinators are more data-specific than
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>primrec</code>, and others are far more general.
  <h2 data-v-c6d54eee>Integers, floats, characters and truth values</h2>
  The data types of Joy are divided into simple and aggregate types. The <em data-v-c6d54eee>simple</em>    types comprise integers, floats (or reals), characters and the truth values.
  The aggregate types comprise sets, strings and lists. Literals of any type cause
  a value of that type to be pushed onto the stack. There they can be manipulated
  by the general stack operations such as <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>dup</kbd>, <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>pop</kbd> and
  <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>swap</kbd> and a few others, or they can be manipulated by operators specific
  to their type. This section introduces literals and operators of the simple types.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    An <em data-v-c6d54eee>integer</em> is just a whole number. Literals of this type are written
    in decimal notation. The following binary operations are provided:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          +        -        *        /        rem
  </pre>
  The first four have their conventional meaning, the last is the operator
  for the remainder after division. Operators are written after their operands.
  Binary operators remove two values from the top of the stack and replace them
  by the result. For example, the program
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          20  3  4  +  *  6  -  100  rem
  </pre>
  evaluates to 34, and this value is left on top of the stack. There are
  also some unary operators specific to integers like the
  <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>abs</kbd> operator which takes the absolute value, and the
  <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>signum</kbd> operator which yields
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>-1</code>,
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>0</code> or <code data-v-c6d54eee>+1</code>, depending on whether its parameter is negative,
  zero or positive.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Apart from the positive and negative integers or whole numbers, Joy has floating
    point numbers or "floats". Literals of this type are written with a decimal
    point and at least one digit after that. Optionally the last digit may be followed
    by 'E' or 'e' and then a positive or negative exponent. Here are some examples:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          3.14     314.0     3.14E5    3.14e-5
  </pre>
  The last two are equivalent to 314000.0 and 0.0000314 . Most operators
  on integers work in the same way for floats. John Cowan's extension also provides
  a large number of functions for floats, but these are outside the scope of this
  tutorial.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    A <em data-v-c6d54eee>character</em> is a letter, a digit, a punctuation character, in fact
    any printable character or one of a few white space characters. Literals of
    type character are written as a single quote followed by the character itself.
    Values of type character are treated very much like small numbers. That means
    that other numbers can be added to them, for example 32 to change letter from
    upper case to lower case. There are two unary operators which are defined on
    characters and on integers:
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>pred</kbd> takes the predecessor,
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>succ</kbd> takes the successor. For example,
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          'A  32  +  succ  succ
  </pre>
  evaluates to <code data-v-c6d54eee>'c</code>, the third lower case letter.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    The type of <em data-v-c6d54eee>truth value</em>s is what in some languages is called
    <em data-v-c6d54eee>Boolean</em>. The following are the two literals, the unary negation operator
    and two binary operators for conjunction and disjunction:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          true        false        not        and        or
  </pre>
  For example, the program
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          false  true  false  not  and  not  or
  </pre>
  evaluates to <code data-v-c6d54eee>false</code>.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Values of type integer and character can be compared using the following <em data-v-c6d54eee>relational operator</em>s:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          =        &lt;        >        !=        &lt;=        >=
  </pre>
  The <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>!=</kbd> operator returns the negation of what the <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>=</kbd>    operator returns. The others have the conventional meaning. As all operators,
  they are written in postfix notation. The result is always a truth value. For
  example,
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          'A  'E  &lt;  2  3  +  15  3  /  =  and
  </pre>
  evaluates to <code data-v-c6d54eee>true</code>.
  <h2 data-v-c6d54eee>Sets, strings and lists</h2>
  The <em data-v-c6d54eee>aggregate</em> types are the unordered type of sets and the ordered
  types of strings and lists. Aggregates can be built up, combined, taken apart
  and tested for membership. This section introduces literals and operators of
  the aggregate types.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    A <em data-v-c6d54eee>set</em> is an unordered collection of zero or more small integers. Literals
    of type set are written inside curly braces, and the empty set is written as
    an empty pair of braces. For set literals the ordering of the elements is irrelevant
    and duplication has no effect. The operators for conjunction and disjunction
    are also defined on sets. For example, the two equivalent programs
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          {1 3 5 7}  {2 4 6 8}  or  {}  or  {3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10}  and
          {3 7 5 1}  {2 4 6 8}  or  {}  or  {3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10} and
  </pre>
  evaluate to <code data-v-c6d54eee>{3 4 5 6 7 8}</code>. The negation operator
  <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>not</kbd> takes complements relative to the largest expressible set, which
  in most implementations will have a maximum of 32 members: from <code data-v-c6d54eee>0</code>    to
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>31</code>.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    A <em data-v-c6d54eee>string</em> is an ordered sequence of zero or more characters. Literals
    of this type string are written inside double quotes, and the empty string
    is written as two adjacent double quotes with nothing inside:
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>""</code>. Note that this is different from the string containing just
    the blank: <code data-v-c6d54eee>" "</code>. Two strings can be concatenated, and a string
    can be reversed. For example,
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
      "dooG"  reverse  " morning"  " "  concat concat  "world"  concat
  </pre>
  evaluates to <code data-v-c6d54eee>"Good morning world"</code>.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    For many operators an implementation can choose whether to make it a primitive or
    define it in a library. Apart from execution speed, to the user it makes no
    difference as to which choice has been made. In the current implementation
    the <code data-v-c6d54eee>reverse</code> operator is defined in a library.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    A <em data-v-c6d54eee>list</em> is an ordered sequence of zero or more values of any type.
    Literals of type list are written inside square brackets, the empty list is
    written as an empty pair of brackets. Lists can contain lists as members, so
    the type of lists is a recursive data type.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Values of the aggregate types, namely sets, strings and lists can be constructed
    from existing ones by adding a new member with the
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>cons</kbd> operator. This is a binary operator for which the first parameter
    must be a possible new member and the second parameter must be an aggregate.
    For sets the new member is added if it is not already there, and for strings
    and lists the new member is added in front. Here are some examples. The programs
    on the left evaluate to the literals on the right.
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          5  3 {2 1}  cons  cons  3  swap  cons                {1 2 3 5}
          'E  'C  "AB"  cons  cons  'C  swap  cons               "CECAB"
          5  [6]  [1 2]  cons  cons  'A  swap  cons       ['A 5 [6] 1 2]
  </pre>
  As the examples show, the <code data-v-c6d54eee>cons</code> operator is most useful for
  adding elements into an aggregate which is already on the stack below the aggregate.
  To add new elements that have just been pushed, the new elements and the aggregate
  have to be <code data-v-c6d54eee>swap</code>ped first before the new element can be <code data-v-c6d54eee>cons</code>ed
  into the aggregate. To facilitate this, Joy has another operator,
  <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>swons</kbd>, which first performs a <code data-v-c6d54eee>swap</code> and then a
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>cons</code>.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Whereas the <code data-v-c6d54eee>cons</code> and <code data-v-c6d54eee>swons</code> operators builds up aggregate
    values, the two unary operators <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>first</kbd> and
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>rest</kbd> take them apart. Both are defined only on non-empty aggregate
    values. For the two ordered aggregate types, strings and lists, the meaning
    is obvious: the first operator returns the first element and the rest operator
    returns the string or list without the first element:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          "CECAB"  first                                              'C
          "CECEB"  rest                                           "ECAB"
          ['A 5 [6] 1 2]  first                                       'A
          ['A 5 [6] 1 2]  rest                               [5 [6] 1 2]
  </pre>
  But sets are unordered, so it does not make sense to speak of their first
  members <em data-v-c6d54eee>as sets</em>. But since their members are integers, the ordering
  on the integers can be used to determine what the first member is. Analogous
  considerations apply to the <code data-v-c6d54eee>rest</code> operator.
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          {5 2 3}  first                                                2
          {5 2 3}  rest                                             {3 5}
  </pre><p data-v-c6d54eee>
    For all three types of aggregates the members other than the first can be extracted
    by repeatedly taking the rest and finally the first of that. This can be cumbersome
    for extracting member deep inside. An alternative is to use the <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>at</kbd>      operator to <em data-v-c6d54eee>index</em> into the aggregate, by extracting a member <b data-v-c6d54eee> at</b>      a numerically specified position. For example, the following are two equivalent
    programs to extract the fifth member of any aggregate:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          rest  rest  rest  rest  first
          5  at
  </pre><p data-v-c6d54eee>
    There is a unary operator which determines the <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>size</kbd> of any aggregate
    value. For sets this is the number of members, for strings its is the length,
    and for lists it is the length counting only top level members. The
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>size</code> operator yields zero for empty aggregates and a positive
    integer for others. There is also a unary
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>null</kbd> operator, a predicate which yields the truth value
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>true</code> for empty aggregates and <code data-v-c6d54eee>false</code> for others. Another
    predicate, the <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>small</kbd> operator, yields
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>true</code> just in case the size is <code data-v-c6d54eee>0</code> or
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>1</code>.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Apart from the operators which only affect the stack, there are two for explicit
    input and output. The <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>get</kbd> operator reads an item from the
    input file and pushes it onto the stack. The
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>put</kbd> operator pops an item off the stack and writes it to the screen
    or whatever the output file is. The next program reads two pairs of integers
    and then compares the sum of the first pair with the sum of the second pair.
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          get  get  +  get  get  +  >  put
  </pre>
  The two <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>get</kbd> operators attempt to read two items and push them
  onto the stack. There they are immediately added, so they have to be integers.
  This is repeated for the second pair. At this point the stack contains the two
  sums. Then the comparison operator pops the two integers and replaces them by
  a truth value, <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>true</kbd> or <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>false</kbd>, depending on whether the
  first sum is less than the second sum. The <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>put</kbd> operator pops that
  truth value and writes it. The stack is now as it was before the program was
  run, only the input file and the output file are changed.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    For another example, the following conducts a silly little dialogue:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          "What is your name?" put "Hello, " get concat put
  </pre>
  First the question string is pushed on the stack and then popped to be
  written out to the screen. Then the <tt data-v-c6d54eee>'"Hello, "'</tt> string is pushed. Next,
  the <code data-v-c6d54eee>get</code> operator reads an item from the keyboard and pushes it onto
  the stack. That item has to be another string, because it will be concatenated
  with what is below it on the stack. The resultant string is then written out.
  So, if in answer to the question a user types <tt data-v-c6d54eee>'"Pat"'</tt>, the program finally
  writes out
  <tt data-v-c6d54eee>'"Hello, Pat"'</tt>.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    In addition to the compound data types set, string and list, John Cowan's extension
    provides a large number of operators for manipulating the file system: opening,
    closing, deleting files, and various input-output operators. These are outside
    the scope of this tutorial.
  <h2 data-v-c6d54eee>Quotations and Combinators</h2>
  Lists are really just a special case of <em data-v-c6d54eee>quoted program</em>s. Lists only
  contain values of the various types, but quoted programs may contain other elements
  such as operators and some others that are explained below. A <em data-v-c6d54eee>quotation</em>    can be treated as passive data structure just like a list. For example,
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [ +  20  *  10  4  - ]
  </pre>
  has size <code data-v-c6d54eee>6</code>, its second and third elements are
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>20</code> and <code data-v-c6d54eee>*</code>, it can be reversed or it can be concatenated
  with other quotations. But passive quotations can also be made active by <em data-v-c6d54eee>dequotation</em>.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    If the above quotation occurs in a program, then it results in the quotation being
    pushed onto the stack - just as a list would be pushed. There are many other
    ways in which that quotation could end up on top of the stack, by being concatenated
    from its parts, by extraction from a larger quotation, or by being read from
    the input. No matter how it got to be on top of the stack, it can now be treated
    in two ways: passively as a data structure, or actively as a program. The square
    brackets prevented it from being treated actively. Without them the program
    would have been executed: it would expect two integers which it would add,
    then multiply the result by 20, and finally push 6, the difference between
    10 and 4.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Joy has certain devices called <em data-v-c6d54eee>combinator</em>s which cause the execution
    of quoted programs that are on top of the stack. This section describes only
    a very small proportion of them.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    One of the simplest is the <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>i</kbd> combinator. Its effect is to execute
    a single program on top of the stack, and nothing else. Syntactically speaking,
    its effect is to remove the quoting square brackets and thus to expose the
    quoted program for execution. Consequently the following two programs are equivalent:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [ +  20  *  10  4  - ]  i
            +  20  *  10  4  -
  </pre>
  The <code data-v-c6d54eee>i</code> combinator is mainly of theoretical significance, but
  it is used occasionally. The many other combinators are essential for programming
  in Joy.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    One of the most well-known combinators is for branching. The
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>ifte</kbd> combinator expects three quoted programs on the stack, an if-part,
    a then-part and an else-part, in that order, with the else-part on top. The
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>ifte</code> combinator removes and saves the three quotations and then
    performs the following on the remainder of the stack: It executes the if-part
    which should leave a truth value on top of the stack. That truth value is saved
    and the stack is restored to what it was before the execution of the if-part.
    Then, if the saved truth value was <code data-v-c6d54eee>true</code>, the <code data-v-c6d54eee>ifte</code>      combinator executes the then-part, otherwise it executes the else-part.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    In most cases the three parts would have been pushed in that order just before the
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>ifte</code> combinator is executed. But any or all of the three parts
    could have been constructed from other quotations.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    In the following example the three parts are pushed just before the
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>ifte</code> combinator is executed. The program looks at a number on
    top of the stack, and if it is greater than 1000 it will halve it, otherwise
    it will triple it.
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [1000 >]  [2 /]  [3 *]  ifte
  </pre><p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Some combinators require that the stack contains values of certain types. Many are
    analogues of higher order functions familiar from other programming languages:
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>map</kbd>,
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>filter</kbd> and
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>fold</kbd>. Others only make sense in Joy. For example, the
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>step</kbd> combinator can be used to access all elements of an aggregate
    in sequence. For strings and lists this means the order of their occurrence,
    for sets it means the underlying order. The following will
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>step</code> through the members of the second list and <code data-v-c6d54eee>swons</code>      them into the initially empty first list. The effect is to reverse the non-empty
    list, yielding
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>[5 6 3 8
    2]</code>.
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          []  [2 8 3 6 5]  [swons]  step
  </pre><p data-v-c6d54eee>
    The <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>map</kbd> combinator expects an aggregate value on top of the stack,
    and it yields another aggregate of the same size. The elements of the new aggregate
    are computed by applying the quoted program to each element of the original
    aggregate. An example was already given in the introduction.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Another combinator that expects an aggregate is the <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>filter</kbd> combinator.
    The quoted program has to yield a truth value. The result is a new aggregate
    of the same type containing those elements of the original for which the quoted
    program yields <code data-v-c6d54eee>true</code>. For example, the quoted program <code data-v-c6d54eee>['Z >]</code>      will yield truth for characters whose numeric values is greater than that of
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>Z</code>. Hence it can be used to remove upper case letters and blanks
    from a string. So the following evaluates to
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>"ohnmith"</code>:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          "John Smith"   ['Z >]   filter
  </pre><p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Sometimes it is necessary to add or multiply or otherwise combine all elements of
    an aggregate value. The <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>fold</kbd> combinator can do just that.
    It requires three parameters: the aggregate to be folded, the quoted value
    to be returned when the aggregate is empty, and the quoted binary operation
    to be used to combine the elements. In some languages the combinator is called
    reduce (because it turns the aggregate into a single value), or insert (because
    it looks as though the binary operation has been inserted between any two members).
    The following two programs compute the sum of the members of a list and the
    sum of the squares of the members of a list. They evaluate to 10 and 38, respectively.
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [2 5 3]  0  [+]  fold
          [2 5 3]  0  [dup * +]  fold
  </pre><p data-v-c6d54eee>
    To compute the average or arithmetic mean of the members of a set or a list, we have
    to divide the sum by the size. (Because of the integer arithmetic, the division
    will produce an inaccurate average.) The aggregate needs to be looked at twice:
    once for the sum and once for the size. So one way to compute the average is
    to duplicate the aggregate value first with the <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>dup</kbd> operator.
    Then take the
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>sum</code> of the top version. Then use the <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>swap</kbd> operator
    to interchange the position of the sum and the original aggregate, so that
    the original is now on top of the stack. Take the size of that. Now the stack
    contains the sum and the size, with the size on top. Apply the division operator
    to obtain the average value.
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          dup  0  [+]  fold  swap  size  /
  </pre>
  One nice feature of this little program is that it works equally for set
  values as for list values. This is because the constituents
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>fold</code> and <code data-v-c6d54eee>size</code> work for both types.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    But there are two aspects of this program which are unsatisfactory. One concerns
    the <code data-v-c6d54eee>dup</code> and
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>swap</code> operators which make the program hard to read. The other
    concerns the sequencing of operations: The program causes the computation of
    the sum to occur before the computation of the size. But it does not matter
    in which order they are computed, in fact on a machine with several processors
    the sum and the size could be computed in parallel. Joy has a combinator which
    addresses this problem: there is <b data-v-c6d54eee>
    one</b> data parameters, the aggregate, which is to be fed to <b data-v-c6d54eee> two</b> functions.
    From each of the functions a value is to be constructed, by calling both functions
    by means of a combinator
    <b data-v-c6d54eee>cleave</b> which produces two values, one for the sum and one for the size.
    The program for the average looks like this:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [0 [+] fold]   [size]   cleave   /
  </pre><h2 data-v-c6d54eee>Definitions</h2>
  In conventional languages the definition of a function of one or more arguments
  has to name these as formal parameters
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>x</code>,
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>y</code> ... For example, the squaring function might be defined by some
  variation of any of the following:
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          square(x)  =  x * x
          (defun (square x)  (* x x))
          square  =  lambda x.x * x
  </pre>
  In Joy formal parameters such as <code data-v-c6d54eee>x</code> above are not required,
  a definition of the squaring function is simply
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          square   ==   dup  *
  </pre>
  This is one of the principal differences between Joy and those languages
  that are based on the lambda calculus. The latter include (the purely functional
  subsets of) Lisp, Scheme, ML and Haskell. All of these are based on the application
  of functions to arguments or actual parameters.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    In definitions and abstractions of functions the formal parameters have to be named
    - <code data-v-c6d54eee>x</code>, <code data-v-c6d54eee>y</code> and so on, or something more informative.
    This is different in Joy. It is based on the composition of functions and not
    on the application of functions to arguments. In definitions and abstractions
    of functions the arguments do not need be named and as formal parameters indeed
    cannot be named. One consequence is that there are no
    <em data-v-c6d54eee>environment</em>s of name-value pairs. Instead the work of environments
    is done by higher order functions called combinators.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Finally, the concrete syntax of the language is an integral part of the language
    and aids in reasoning about Joy programs in the metalanguage.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Suppose it is required to transform a list of numbers into the list of their cubes.
    The cube of a single number is of course computed by
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          dup  dup  *  *
  </pre>
  It would be possible to introduce a definition of the cube function. But
  that would introduce another name, <code data-v-c6d54eee>cube</code>. If the cube function is
  used only once for computing the cubes of a list of numbers, then it may not
  be desirable to give a definition of it at all. In Joy the list of cubes is computed
  by the first line below, but it is also possible to give an explicit definition
  as in the second line.
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [dup dup * *]  map
          cubelist   ==   [dup dup * *] map
  </pre>
  In a language that is based on the lambda calculus both would need a lambda
  abstraction with a variable, say
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>x</code>, for the number to be cubed. And of course the second line would
  need an additional formal parameter, say <code data-v-c6d54eee>l</code>, or a lambda abstraction
  with a variable <code data-v-c6d54eee>l</code> for the list to which the cubelist function is
  to be applied.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Suppose now that it is required to transform a <em data-v-c6d54eee>list of lists</em> of numbers
    into the <em data-v-c6d54eee>list of lists</em> of their cubes. One might give the definition
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          cubelistlist   ==   [ [dup dup * *] map ]  map
  </pre>
  Of course, if that function is only to be used once, one might not bother
  to give a definition at all but use the right hand side directly. In languages
  based on abstraction, at least two formal parameters are needed just for the
  right hand side, and another for the definition itself. For example, in Scheme
  the definition looks like this:
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          (define (cubelistlist ll)
                  (map (lambda (l)
                       (map (lambda (n) (* n (* n n)))
                             l ) )
                   ll )
  </pre>
  Here the two formal parameters are <code data-v-c6d54eee>n</code> for the number and
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>l</code> for the list of numbers on the right hand side, and
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>ll</code> for the list of lists of numbers in the definition itself.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    As in other languages, definitions can be recursive in Joy. In the first line below
    is a recursive definition of the factorial function in one of many variants
    of conventional notation. In the second line is a recursive definition in Joy.
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          factorial(x)  =  if x = 0 then 1 else x * factorial(x - 1)
          factorial  ==  [0 =] [pop 1] [dup 1 - factorial *] ifte
  </pre>
  Again the Joy version does not use a formal parameter <code data-v-c6d54eee>x</code>.
  It works like this: The definition uses the <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>ifte</kbd> combinator immediately
  after the if-part, the then-part and the else-part have been pushed.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    The <code data-v-c6d54eee>ifte</code> combinator then does this: it executes the if-part, in
    this case <code data-v-c6d54eee>[0 =]</code>, which tests whether the (anonymous) integer parameter
    is equal to zero. If it is, then the if-part is executed, in this case <code data-v-c6d54eee>[pop 1]</code>,
    which pops the parameter off the stack and replaces it by one. Otherwise the
    else-part is executed, in this case <code data-v-c6d54eee>[dup 1 - factorial
    *]</code>. This uses <code data-v-c6d54eee>dup</code> to make another copy of the parameter and
    subtracts one from the copy. Then the
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>factorial</code> function is called recursively on that. Finally the
    original parameter and the just computed factorial are multiplied.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    The definition could be shortened and made a little more efficient by using the inbuilt
    predicate <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>null</kbd> which tests for zero and the <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>pred</kbd>      operator which takes the predecessor of a number. But these changes are insignificant.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    For more complex functions of several arguments it is necessary to be able to access
    the arguments anywhere in the definition. Joy avoids formal parameters altogether,
    and hence in general arbitrary access has to be done by mechanisms more sophisticated
    than <code data-v-c6d54eee>dup</code>,
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>swap</code> and <code data-v-c6d54eee>pop</code>.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Here are some more definitions that one might have:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          sum   ==   0  [+]  fold
          product   ==   1  [*]  fold
          average   ==   [sum]  [size]  constr12  /
          concatenation   ==   ""  [concat]  fold
  </pre>
  The last definition is for an operator which yields a single string which
  is the concatenation of a list of strings.
  <h2 data-v-c6d54eee>Recursive Combinators</h2>
  If one wanted to compute the list of factorials of a given list, this could
  be done by
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [ factorial ]  map
  </pre>
  But this relies on an external definition of factorial. It was necessary
  to give that definition explicitly because it is recursive. If one only wanted
  to compute factorials of lists of numbers, then it would be a minor nuisance
  to be forced to define factorial explicitly just because the definition is recursive.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    A high proportion of recursively defined functions exhibit a very simple pattern:
    There is some test, the if-part, which determines whether the ground case obtains.
    If it does, then the non-recursive then-part is executed. Otherwise the recursive
    else-part has to be executed. In the else-part there is only <em data-v-c6d54eee>one</em>      recursive call, and there can be something before the recursive call and something
    after the recursive call. It helps to think of the else-part to have two components,
    the else1-part before the recursive call, and the else2-part after the recursive
    call. This pattern is called
    <em data-v-c6d54eee>linear recursion</em>, and it occurs very frequently.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Joy has a useful device, the <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>linrec</kbd> combinator, which allows computation
    of anonymous functions that <em data-v-c6d54eee>might</em> have been defined recursively using
    a linear recursive pattern. Whereas the <code data-v-c6d54eee>ifte</code> combinator requires
    three quoted parameters, the
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>linrec</code> combinator requires four: an if-part, a then-part, an else1-part
    and an else2-part. For example, the factorial function could be computed by
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [null]  [succ]  [dup pred]  [*]  linrec
  </pre>
  There is no need for a definition, the above program can be used directly.
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Very frequently the if-part of a linear recursion tests for a simple base condition
    which depends on the type of the parameter. For numbers that condition tends
    to be being zero, for sets, strings and lists that condition tends to be being
    empty. The else1-part frequently makes the parameter smaller in some way. For
    numbers it decrements them, for sets, strings and lists it takes the
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>rest</kbd>.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Joy has another useful combinator which has the appropriate if-part and else1-part
    built in. This is the
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>primrec</kbd> combinator, which only has to be supplied with two quotation
    parameters, the (modified) then-part and the else2-part of linear recursion.
    For the factorial function the two quotation parameters are very simple:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [1]  [*]  primrec
  </pre>
  computes the factorial function. So, if one wanted to compute the list
  of factorial of a given list of numbers this can be done by either of the following:
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [ [null]  [succ]  [dup pred]  [*]  linrec ]   map
          [ [1]  [*]  primrec ]   map
  </pre>
  The factorial of a number is the product of successive natural numbers
  up to the actual parameter. The following compute instead their sums and the
  sum of their squares:
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [0]  [+]  primrec
          [0]  [dup * +]  primrec
  </pre>
  Many of the Joy combinators are polymorphic in the sense that they can
  be applied to parameters of quite different types. The combinator
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>primrec</code> can be applied not only to numbers but also to lists. For
  example, applied to the list
  <code data-v-c6d54eee>[1 2 3]</code> the program
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [[]]  [[] cons cons]  primrec
  </pre>
  produces the list <code data-v-c6d54eee>[1 [2 [3 []]]]</code>. Lisp programmers will recognise
  a similarity to "dotted pairs". In the following, the first turns a set of numbers
  into a list, the second turns a list of numbers into a set:
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [[]]  [cons]  primrec
          [{}]  [cons]  primrec
  </pre>
  In fact, the first can also be applied to a list and the second can also
  be applied to a set. But in that case they just compute the identity. They can
  even be applied to numbers - and then they produce a list or a set of numbers
  from the parameter down to 1.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    In many recursive definitions there are two recursive calls of the function being
    defined. This is the pattern of <em data-v-c6d54eee>binary
    recursion</em>, and it is used in the usual definitions of quicksort and of the
    Fibonacci function. Joy has a facility that eliminates the need for a recursive
    definition, the <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>binrec</kbd> combinator.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    The following will <em data-v-c6d54eee>quicksort</em> a list whose members can be a mixture
    of anything except lists. The program easily fits onto one line, but for reference
    it is here written over several numbered lines:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
      1           [small]
      2           []
      3           [uncons [>] split]
      4           [[swap] dip cons concat]
      5           binrec
  </pre>
  This is how it works: Lines 1..4 each push a quoted program. In line 5
  the <code data-v-c6d54eee>binrec</code> combinator is called, and it will make use of the four
  quoted programs and below that the list to be sorted. The four quoted programs
  are saved elsewhere, and the <code data-v-c6d54eee>binrec</code> combinator begins by executing
  the program from line 1. This tests whether the list to be sorted is small, i.e.
  has at most one member. If indeed it is small, then it is sorted already.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    The <code data-v-c6d54eee>binrec</code> combinator now executes the program from line 2, which
    does nothing and hence leaves the small list as it is. On the other hand, if
    the list is not small, then the programs in lines 3 and 4 will be executed.
    The program in line 3 removes the first element from the list and uses it as
    a pivot to split the rest of the list into two sublists, by using the comparison
    function in
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>[>]</code> and the <code data-v-c6d54eee>split</code> combinator.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    At this point the <code data-v-c6d54eee>binrec</code> combinator calls itself recursively on
    the two sublists and sorts them both. Finally the program in line 4 combines
    the two sorted versions and the original pivot into a single sorted list. The
    three items are not quite in the required order, so the <code data-v-c6d54eee>[swap] dip</code>      part puts the pivot in between the two sorted lists.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Then <code data-v-c6d54eee>cons</code> puts the pivot in front of the topmost string or list,
    and finally <code data-v-c6d54eee>concat</code> combines everything into one single sorted
    list. Since all operations in the program also work on strings, the program
    itself can equally well be used to sort a string.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    In fact, the program can be used on sets too, but this of course is pointless. The
    program is useful, it is part of the Joy system library under the name of <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>qsort</kbd>.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Many other functions are often defined by recursive definitions that use binary recursion.
    In Joy they can all be computed with the
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>binrec</code> combinator without the need for a definition. For example,
    the following computes the
    <em data-v-c6d54eee>Fibonacci</em> function; it implements the usual inefficient algorithm:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [small]  []  [pred dup pred]  [+]  binrec
  </pre>
  The system library of course contains the well known efficient algorithm.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    There are only a few second order combinators, ones which require a first order combinator
    as parameter. One of the is <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>treerec</kbd> for recursing through
    <em data-v-c6d54eee>tree</em>s. These are either anything but a list, or lists of trees. For
    example, in the following
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>treerec</code> is given <code data-v-c6d54eee>[map]</code> as a parameter, which in turn
    will be given <code data-v-c6d54eee>[dup *]</code> as a parameter when
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>treerec</code> encounters a list. The function to be applied to numbers
    possibly deeply embedded within lists is the squaring function
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>[dup *]</code>.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Here is an example:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [ 1 [2 3] [[[4]]] 5 ]  [dup *]  [map]  treerec
  </pre>
  produces
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [ 1 [2 9] [[[16]]] 25 ]
  </pre><p data-v-c6d54eee>
    All of these combinators can be defined in other functional languages, but they are
    less useful there. This is because their parameters have to be abstractions
    with variables, and not quotations as in Joy.
  <h2 data-v-c6d54eee>Programming with aggregates</h2>
  The <em data-v-c6d54eee>aggregate</em> types of Joy are lists, sets and strings. There are several
  unary operators which take an aggregate as parameter and produce as value a list
  of subaggregates. One of these is the
  <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>powerlist</kbd> operator. For an aggregate of size <tt data-v-c6d54eee>N</tt> it produces
  a list of all the <tt data-v-c6d54eee>2^N</tt> subaggregates.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Here is an example:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [1 2 3]  powerlist
  </pre>
  produces as result
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [ [1 2 3] [1 2] [1 3] [1] [2 3] [2] [3] [] ]
  </pre>
  If the ordering does not suit, the result list can always be rearranged,
  for example it can be reversed. For another example, one can sort the list according
  to size. The
  <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>mk_qsort</kbd> combinator expects an aggregate and a quoted operator as
  parameters and it applies the operator to each member of the aggregate to use
  as the basis for sorting them.
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [1 2 3]  powerlist  [size]  mk_qsort
  </pre>
  produces as a result
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          [ [] [1] [2] [3] [1 2] [1 3] [2 3] [1 2 3] ]
  </pre><p data-v-c6d54eee>
    The powerlist operators can also be applied to a string. The result is a list of
    all substrings. In the following the result list is
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>filter</kbd>ed to retain only those substrings whose size is greater than
    3. This is achieved by the
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>filter</kbd> combinator which expects an aggregate and a quoted predicate.
    The first line is the program, the second line is the result:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          "abcde"  powerlist  [size 3 >]  filter
          [ "abcde" "abcd" "abce" "abde" "acde" "bcde" ]
  </pre><p data-v-c6d54eee>
    The powerlist operators can also be applied to a set. In the program on the first
    line below the list of subsets is then filtered to retain only those of size
    3; the result is the list of subsets in the second line:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          {1 2 3 4}  powerlist  [size 3 =]  filter
          [ {1 2 3} {1 2 4} {1 3 4} {2 3 4} ]
  </pre><p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Suppose it is required to find the list, in ascending order, of all sums of any three
    distinct numbers taken from a given set of numbers. We already know how to
    get the list of all three-membered subsets. Each should be replaced by its
    sum, and that can be done with the
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>map</kbd> combinator applied to the whole list. The resulting list of
    sums then needs to be sorted. The example in the first line does just that,
    giving the result in the second line:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
          {1 2 3 4 5}  powerlist  [size 3 =] filter  [sum] map  qsort
          [6 7 8 8 9 9 10 10 11 12]
  </pre><p data-v-c6d54eee>
    In the remainder of this section a small program is to be constructed which takes
    one sequence as parameter and returns the list of all
    <em data-v-c6d54eee>permutation</em>s of that sequence. Here is a first draft:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
  1         If  S has only zero or one member
  2             then it has only one permutation, so take its unit list
  3             else  take the first and rest of S,
                      recurse to construct the permutations of the rest
  4                   insert the first in all positions in all permutations
  </pre><p data-v-c6d54eee>
    The recursion pattern is linear, so we can use the <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>linrec</kbd> combinator
    to arrive at this first incomplete program:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
  1       [ small ]
  2       [ unitlist ]
  3       [ uncons ]
  4       [ "insert the first in all positions in all permutations" ]
  5       linrec
  </pre>
  The anonymous recursion between steps 3 and 4 will have left a list of
  permutations of the rest of <code data-v-c6d54eee>S</code> on top of the stack.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Next, it is necessary to insert the original first of <code data-v-c6d54eee>S</code> into all
    positions into all these resulting permutations. This involves replacing each
    single permutation by a list of permuations with the original first inserted
    in all places.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    This calls for the <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>map</kbd> combinator to apply a
    <em data-v-c6d54eee>constructed program</em> to each permutation. The original first is currently
    the second item on the stack. to make it available to the program to be constructed,
    it is <code data-v-c6d54eee>swap</code>ped to the top. The required program consists of a constant
    part and a variable part.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    The constant part now has to be pushed onto the stack. Then the first is <code data-v-c6d54eee>cons</code>ed
    into the required program. Then
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>map</code> will create a list of list of permutations. But this is a
    two-level list, and it should be one-level. So the two level list has to be
    flattened to a one-level list.
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
  4.1             [ swap
  4.2               [ "the constant part of the program" ]
  4.3               cons map
  4.4               "flatten the resulting list of lists of sequences" ]
  </pre><p data-v-c6d54eee>
    The constant part of the constructed program has to be written next. The constructed
    program will be used to <code data-v-c6d54eee>map</code> all permutations of the rest,
    and in each case it will begin by pushing the original first on top of the
    current permutation being mapped. It then has to insert this first into all
    positions of the current permutation.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    This again calls for a linear recursion with
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>linrec</kbd>. One way to do this is to give this anonymous recursive function
    just one parameter, the current permutation with the original first
    <code data-v-c6d54eee>swons</code> in as an initial element. So the task is now to insert this
    inital element into all positions in the remainder which is the current permutation.
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
  4.2.2.1         If  the current sequence is small
  4.2.2.2             then return just its unit list
  4.2.2.3             else  keep  1. a copy
                                  2. its second and
                                  3. the sequence without its second
                            anonymously recurse on 3.
  4.2.2.4                   construct a program to insert the second
                            use <code data-v-c6d54eee>map</code> to do the insertion
                            use <code data-v-c6d54eee>cons</code> to add the copy from 1.
  </pre>
  So the constant part 4.2 looks like this:
  <br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
  4.2.1             [ swons
  4.2.2.1             [ small ]
  4.2.2.2             [ unitlist ]
  4.2.2.3             [ dup unswons [uncons] dip swons ]
  4.2.2.4             [ swap [swons] cons map cons ]
  4.2.2.5             linrec ]
  </pre><p data-v-c6d54eee>
    The only other part that needs to be written is for flattening. This should be trivial
    by now: If the list is small, then take its unit list else take its first and
    its rest anonymously recurse on the rest, concatenate the saved first into
    the result.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Here is the required program:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
  4.4             [ null ] [ ] [ uncons ] [ concat]  linrec
  </pre><p data-v-c6d54eee>
    The entire program now is the following:
    <br data-v-c6d54eee><br data-v-c6d54eee><pre data-v-c6d54eee>  
  1               [ small ]
  2               [ unitlist ]
  3               [ uncons ]
  4.1             [ swap
  4.2.1             [ swons
  4.2.2.1             [ small ]
  4.2.2.2             [ unitlist ]
  4.2.2.3             [ dup unswons [uncons] dip swons ]
  4.2.2.4             [ swap [swons] cons map cons ]
  4.2.2.5             linrec ]
  4.3               cons map
  4.4               [null] [] [uncons] [concat] linrec ]
  5               linrec.
  </pre><p data-v-c6d54eee>
    An essentially identical program is in the Joy library under the name
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>permlist</kbd>. It is considerably shorter than the one given here because
    it uses two subsidiary programs
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>insertlist</kbd> and
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>flatten</kbd> which are useful elsewhere. The program given above is an
    example of a non-trivial program which uses the
    <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>linrec</kbd> combinator three times and the <kbd data-v-c6d54eee>map</kbd> combinator
    twice, with <em data-v-c6d54eee>constructed program</em>s as parameters on both occasions.
  <p data-v-c6d54eee>
    Of course such a program can be written in lambda calculus languages such as <em data-v-c6d54eee>Lisp</em>,
    <em data-v-c6d54eee>Scheme</em>, <em data-v-c6d54eee>ML</em> or
    <em data-v-c6d54eee>Haskell</em>, but it would need many recursive definitions with attendant
    named formal parameters.
  <h2 data-v-c6d54eee>Miscellaneous</h2>
  The current implementation has many other features that are best described in
  more specialised documentation. For a brief glance at what is available, see
  the output from the
  <a href="allhelp" data-v-c6d54eee>online help</a> command. This gives just a list of
  the names of primitives and defined functions when all libraries are loaded.
  For an actual description of the current primitives, see the output from the
  <a href="plain-manual" data-v-c6d54eee>online manual</a> command. For definitions of
  the defined functions, consult the various libraries in section 3 of the main
  page.
