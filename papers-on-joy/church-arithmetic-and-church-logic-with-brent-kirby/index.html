  Numbers are often taken to be be sets or constructions out of sets.
  Thus the number five can be taken to be the set of all those sets
  that have 5 members: the set of fingers on my left hand, the set
  of fingers on my right hand, the set of working days in the week,
  and so on. 
  In this scheme the number zero is the set of all those
  sets that have no members,
  it is the set that has just the null-set as its sole member.
  On another scheme the number zero is the null-set, and any other
  natural number is the set of its predecessors.
  On both schemes natural numbers are possible answers to the question
  "how many" or more precisely, "how many things".
  <p data-v-f0d98270>
    But natural numbers can equally well be taken to be answers
    to the question "how many times" or "how often".
    This is how they are treated in Church's lambda calculus.
    They are functions which take a unary function as argument
    and return a unary function as value.
    If the argument function is the squaring function,
    and the number in question is three,
    then the returned function computes the square of the square of the square.
    So numbers are second order functions.
    But since they are unary functions, they can be applied to themselves
    at least in the untyped lambda calculus.
    So numbers are also third order functions, and so forth - 
    they are simply higher order functions.
  <p data-v-f0d98270>
    Numbers must be distinguished from numerals or more generally,
    numeric expressions.
    The numerals "7", "seven", "sept", "VII"
    and also the expressions "3+4" and "10-3"
    are all different, and yet they denote the same natural number.
    The so-called Church numerals of the lambda calculus are expressions
    which denote higher order functions of the kind described above.
    The remainder of this note shows how Church numerals
    can also be expressed in Joy.
  <h1 data-v-f0d98270>Church numerals</h1>
  In Joy a Church numeral will have to  be a program which
  expects on the stack a quoted program, say [P], and below that whatever
  parameters are needed to execute the quoted program.
  The numeral will indicate how often [P] is to be executed:
  not at all, once, twice, thrice, or whatever.
  <p data-v-f0d98270>
    First, the Church numeral C0, which is to execute
    the quoted program [P] zero times.
    Clearly this is achieved by just popping off the quoted program.
  <p data-v-f0d98270>
    The other Church numerals will have to be constructed from
    C0 together with Csucc, a successor function for Church numerals.
    This function Csucc will take as parameters a quoted
    Church numeral, say Cn, and below that whatever quotation is to be
    executed repeatedly.
    So a program of the form ... [P] [Cn] Csucc  should
    execute [P] exactly (n+1) times.
    This can be done by executing [P] once, and then again n times.
    So Csucc should first execute a copy of [P] and then
    allow Cn to execute [P] n times.
  <p data-v-f0d98270>
    Here are the definitions of C0 and Csucc:<br data-v-f0d98270><pre data-v-f0d98270> DEFINE 
        C0  ==  pop; 
        Csucc  ==  [dup [i] dip] dip i. 
  </pre>
  Church numerals do not denote numbers as data values
  but numbers as repetitions of execution of a program.
  So they need a program [P] to be repeated zero or more
  times.
  Preferably the output should bear some resemblance
  to what is being tested.
  A good choice is the ordinary successor function succ
  for ordinary numbers, to be called
  zero or more times with the ordinary number 0 on top of the stack.
  <pre data-v-f0d98270> DEFINE 
        Peano  ==  0 [succ]. 
  </pre>
  Here are the obvious tests:<br data-v-f0d98270><pre data-v-f0d98270> Peano C0. 
  0
    Peano [C0] Csucc. 
  1
    Peano [[C0] Csucc] Csucc. 
  2
    Peano [[[C0] Csucc] Csucc] Csucc. 
  3
  </pre>
  It is convenient to introduce definitions
  for the first few positive Church numerals.
  The tests follow.
  <pre data-v-f0d98270> DEFINE 
        C1  ==  [C0] Csucc; 
        C2  ==  [C1] Csucc; 
        C3  ==  [C2] Csucc. 
  </pre><pre data-v-f0d98270> Peano C0. 
  0
    Peano C1. 
  1
    Peano C2. 
  2
    Peano C3. 
  3
  </pre>
  Instead of using the natural numbers, with 0 and [succ],
  for tests of the Church numerals, we can also use many others data structures.
  Here are two examples:
  <pre data-v-f0d98270> DEFINE 
        Doublings  ==  1 [2 *]; 
        Lists  ==  [] [[i] swoncat]. 
  </pre><pre data-v-f0d98270> Doublings C0. 
  1
    Doublings C1. 
  2
    Doublings C2. 
  4
    Doublings C3. 
  8
  </pre><pre data-v-f0d98270> Lists C0. 
  []
    Lists C1. 
  [i]
    Lists C2. 
  [i i]
    Lists C3. 
  [i i i]
  </pre><h1 data-v-f0d98270>Arithmetic operators for Church numerals</h1>
  Church numerals in the lambda calculus or in Joy
  can be added, multiplied and exponentiated just like
  ordinary numerals.
  The three operators Cadd, Cmul and Cpow all take
  two quoted Church numerals [Cm] and [Cn] as parameters.
  Of course below those two quotations they expect the quoted 
  function that is to be repeated, and below that the initial value.
  <p data-v-f0d98270>
    To add two numbers m and n, we can take the n-th successor of m.
    This is also what the definition of Cadd below will do.
    It will transform the quotation [Cm] into another quotation
    by repeatedly constructing the successor quotation,
    where the number of repetitions is given by [Cn] which
    is called by the first i.
    The reculting quotion is then called by the final i.
  <p data-v-f0d98270>
    To multiply two numbers m and n, we can start with 0 and add m
    exactly n times.
    To exponentiate, to compute m to the n-th power,
    we start with 1 and multiply by m exactly n times.
    This is also what the definitions of Cmul and Cpow do.
    They are more complex than the definition for Cadd
    for two reasons:
    the starting values C0 and C1 have to be specified,
    and also the operations Cadd and Cmul which they
    use are binary.
    The starting values are quoted, as [C0] and [C1] respectively,
    and they are squeezed below the [Cm] and [Cn].
    At the same time [Cm] is transformed into 
    either [[[Cm] Cadd] cons] or [[[Cm] Cmul] cons] respectively.
    This is then repeatedly executed, where the number
    of repetitions is given by [Cn] which is calle by the first i.
    The resulting quotation is then called by the final i.
  <p data-v-f0d98270>
    Here follow the definitions and two forms of tests.<br data-v-f0d98270><pre data-v-f0d98270> DEFINE 
        Cadd  ==  [ [[Csucc] cons] ] dip i i; 
        Cmul  ==  [ [[C0]] dip  [Cadd] cons [cons] cons ] dip i i; 
        Cpow  ==  [ [[C1]] dip  [Cmul] cons [cons] cons ] dip i i. 
  </pre><pre data-v-f0d98270> Peano [C2] [C3] Cadd. 
  5
    Peano [C2] [C3] Cmul. 
  6
    Peano [C2] [C3] Cpow. 
  8
  </pre><pre data-v-f0d98270> Doublings [C2] [C3] Cadd. 
  32
    Doublings [C2] [C3] Cmul. 
  64
    Doublings [C2] [C3] Cpow. 
  256
  </pre>
  The operators can of course be used in complex expressions,
  as in these examples.
  The first just computes a value,
  and the second  compares the same value with
  the identical value obtained from ordinary arithmetic.
  <pre data-v-f0d98270> Peano [[[[[C3] Csucc] [C2] Cadd] [C3] Cmul] Csucc] [C2] Cadd . 
  21
    Peano [[[[[C3] Csucc] [C2] Cadd] [C3] Cmul] Csucc] [C2] Cadd 
                3   succ    2   +      3   *     succ    2   +      = . 
  true
  </pre>
  As the second example shows, the value computed using
  Church arithmetic is the same as the one using ordinary arithmetic.
  However, the example also shows up how complex the expressions
  using Church arithmetic become when compared with ordinary expressions.
  This is because the Church operators need quotations as
  parameters, and hence the Church expression contains
  many square brackets whereas the ordinary expression
  requires none.
  So it seems that the quotation brackets are
  performing somewhat the same role as the
  ordinary grouping parentheses are performing
  in infix notation.
  <p data-v-f0d98270>
    It is of some interest to see whether this is an inherent
    problem with expressing Church arithmetic in Joy,
    or whether there is a way of expressing Church arithmetic
    in Joy that retains the usual bracket free notation
    of Joy as for ordinary arithmetic.
  <h1 data-v-f0d98270>Quotation numerals and Quotation operators</h1>
  In Joy it is possible to define quotations and also
  quotation producing operators on quotations.
  Such quotations can then be executed by the i combinator
  or any other combinator.
  For an analogue of Church arithmetic
  the quotations will have to be the quoted Church numerals.
  These will be called quotation numerals.
  The quotation operators, corresponding to the Church operators,
  will take quotations off the stack and
  leave a new quotation on top of the stack.
  <p data-v-f0d98270>
    The remainder of this section defines quotation numerals
    and quotation operators in the same sequence as in the
    two preceding sections.
  <p data-v-f0d98270>
    First, the quotation numeral Q0 and the quotation operator Qsucc:<br data-v-f0d98270><pre data-v-f0d98270> DEFINE 
        Q0  ==  [pop]; 
        Qsucc  ==  [ [dup [i] dip] dip i ]  cons. 
  </pre><pre data-v-f0d98270> Peano Q0 i. 
  0
    Peano Q0 Qsucc i. 
  1
    Peano Q0 Qsucc Qsucc i. 
  2
  </pre><pre data-v-f0d98270> DEFINE 
        Q1  ==  Q0 Qsucc; 
        Q2  ==  Q1 Qsucc; 
        Q3  ==  Q2 Qsucc. 
  </pre><pre data-v-f0d98270> Peano Q0 i. 
  0
    Peano Q1 i. 
  1
    Peano Q2 i. 
  2
    Peano Q3 i. 
  3
  </pre>
  Since Church numerals denote (higher order) functions,
  they cannot be written - they do not have a finite representation.
  However, this is not true of the quotation numerals as just defined -
  these can be written since they are just quoted programs
  to compute such functions.
  Here are the first four quotation numerals:
  <pre data-v-f0d98270> Q0. 
  [pop]
    Q1. 
  [[pop] [dup [i] dip] dip i]
    Q2. 
  [[[pop] [dup [i] dip] dip i] [dup [i] dip] dip i]
    Q3. 
  [[[[pop] [dup [i] dip] dip i] [dup [i] dip] dip i] [dup [i] dip] dip i]
  </pre><p data-v-f0d98270>
    The quotation operators for addition, multiplication and exponentiation
    are just like the quotation operator Qsucc:
    they expect quotations as parameters and produce quotations as results.
    Their definitions below are a simple adaptation of the 
    corresponding Church operators.
    A few tests also follow.
  <pre data-v-f0d98270> DEFINE 
        Qadd  == 
          [ [[Qsucc i] cons] swap i i ]  cons cons; 
        Qmul  == 
          [ [[[Q0 i]] dip [Qadd i] cons [cons] cons] dip i i ] cons cons; 
        Qpow  == 
          [ [[[Q1 i]] dip [Qmul i] cons [cons] cons] dip i i ] cons cons. 
  </pre><pre data-v-f0d98270>  
    Peano Q2 Q3 Qadd i . 
  5
    Peano Q2 Q3 Qmul i . 
  6
    Peano Q2 Q3 Qpow i . 
  8
  </pre>
  Again, because these three quotation operators
  take quotations as parameters and produce quotations,
  the result quotations can always be written without being called:
  <pre data-v-f0d98270> Q2 Q3 Qadd . 
  [[[[pop] [dup [i] dip] dip i] [dup [i] dip] dip i] [[[[pop] [dup [i] dip] dip i] [dup [i] dip] dip i] [dup [i] dip] dip i] [[Qsucc i] cons] swap i i]
    Q2 Q3 Qmul .

  </pre><h1 data-v-f0d98270>Church truth values</h1>
  Whereas Church numerals can be taken to be answers to the question "how often",
  Church truth values can be taken to be answers to the question "which one",
  when there is a choice of two.
  From an operational point of view,
  Church numerals represent looping (for-loops),
  and Church numerals represent branching.
  Whereas CHurch numerals take as a parameter one function,
  Church truth values take two parameters of which one will be
  ignored and the other evaluated.
  In Joy these two parameters will have to be quotations
  on the top of the stack.
  As for Church numerals, Church truth values do not denote data values,
  but choices between executing one of two quoted programs
  to be executed.
  <p data-v-f0d98270>
    Here are the definitions of the two Church truth values,
    also two pairs of functions, and of course some tests.
  <pre data-v-f0d98270>  
    DEFINE  
        Ctrue  ==  pop i; 
        Cfalse  ==  popd i. 
  </pre><pre data-v-f0d98270> DEFINE 
        Boole  ==  ["Yes, yes"] ["No, no"]; 
        Comparison  ==  2 3 [&lt;] [>]. 
  </pre><pre data-v-f0d98270> Boole Ctrue. 
  "Yes, yes"
    Boole Cfalse. 
  "No, no"
    Comparison Ctrue. 
  true
    Comparison Cfalse. 
  false
  </pre>
  The negation operator for Church truth values
  will take as its parameter a quotation which,
  when executed, will expect two quotations on the stack.
  In analogy with the definition of Church negation in
  the lambda calculus,
  the Cnot operator for Church truthvalues in Joy might be defined as
  <pre data-v-f0d98270> DEFINE
        Cnot  ==  [ [Cfalse] [Ctrue] ] dip i. 
  </pre>
  However, because Joy is stack-based,
  a much simpler definition results if the Cnot operator
  simply swaps the two quotation parameters
  below the Church truth value, as follows.
  <pre data-v-f0d98270> DEFINE 
        Cnot  ==  swapd i. 
  </pre><pre data-v-f0d98270> Boole [Ctrue] Cnot. 
  "No, no"
    Boole [Cfalse] Cnot. 
  "Yes, yes"
    Comparison [[Ctrue] Cnot] Cnot. 
  true
    Comparison [[Cfalse] Cnot] Cnot. 
  false
  </pre>
  The definition of the two binary operators
  on Church truth values look quite different
  from the binary operators on Church numerals.
  This is because Church truth values take
  two quotation parameters, whereas Church numerals
  only take one.
  Apart from that, the definitions of the
  disjunction and conjunction operators
  on truth values are actually simpler than
  those for Church numerals.
  <p data-v-f0d98270>
    Both operators expect two quotations denoting Church truth values.
    Both may need to be executed to determine the result of the
    binary operation.
    In the case of disjunction, Cor,
    if the evaluation of the top quotation yields Ctrue,
    then the other quotation will be discarded
    and the quotation below that will be executed.
    That will have to be the quotation [Ctrue],
    which will have to be placed there before Cor
    can execute the top quotation.
    On the other hand, if the evaluation of the top
    quotation yields Cfalse, then the added quotation [Ctrue]
    will be discarded and the second quotation
    will be executed whose result then fully determines
    the result yielded by Cor.
    Since the second quotation is only executed when
    its result is needed,
    this definition of Cor is what is sometimes
    called a "short circuit" implementation.
  <p data-v-f0d98270>
    The definition of Cand is entirely analogous.
    The four tests for Cor and for Cand also follow.
  <pre data-v-f0d98270> DEFINE 
        Cor  ==  [[Ctrue]] dipd i; 
        Cand  ==  [[Cfalse]] dip i. 
  </pre><pre data-v-f0d98270> Boole [Ctrue ] [Ctrue ] Cor. 
  "Yes, yes"
    Boole [Ctrue ] [Cfalse] Cor. 
  "Yes, yes"
    Boole [Cfalse] [Ctrue ] Cor. 
  "Yes, yes"
    Boole [Cfalse] [Cfalse] Cor. 
  "No, no"

    Boole [Ctrue ] [Ctrue ] Cand. 
  "Yes, yes"
    Boole [Ctrue ] [Cfalse] Cand. 
  "No, no"
    Boole [Cfalse] [Ctrue ] Cand. 
  "No, no"
    Boole [Cfalse] [Cfalse] Cand. 
  "No, no"
  </pre><h1 data-v-f0d98270>Church predicates, Church conditionals and Church lists</h1>
  The operators for Church logic are not so useful
  when they can only operate on Church truth value constants Ctrue and Cfalse.
  But they become more useful when there are predicates whose
  evaluation yields Church truth values.
  <p data-v-f0d98270>
    Below is the definition of just one such predicate,
    the unary predicate Ceq0 which tests whether its
    parameter on the top of the stack is equal to zero,
    or better: whether it is C0.
    In the case of equality Ceq0 has to behave like
    Ctrue, otherwise it has to behave like Cfalse.
    To perform the test, it has to execute its parameter,
    which is a quotation [Cn] of a Church numeral
    or a quotation which eventually yields such a numeral.
    Below that parameter has to be a quotation which
    might not be executed at all if n=0,
    but might be executed many times.
    In the first case, when n=0,
    the Church numeral C0 has already been executed,
    and the redundant quotation has already been popped,
    but now Ctrue has to be executed.
    In the other cases, when n is positive,
    the Church numeral will have executed a a quotation
    several times, but now Cfalse has to be executed.
  <p data-v-f0d98270>
    The definition below will do just that.
    First, below the quotation [Cn] it inserts two
    other quotations,
    [Ctrue] and [pop [Cfalse]].
    The second of these may be executed zero or more times.
    The first time, if ever, it will replace the [Ctrue] by
    [Cfalse], and any further time it will replace
    the [Cfalse] it has placed there last time by a new [Cfalse].
    After these two quotations have been inserted 
    below the quoted Church numeral [Cn],
    the first i executes [Cn],
    resulting in either the original [Ctrue]
    or a [Cfalse] to become the top element on the stack.
    Finally, the second i executes that, as required.
  <p data-v-f0d98270>
    After the definitions there are some obvious tests,
    and the last two also use the equality predicate
    in expressions using Cor and Cand.
  <pre data-v-f0d98270> DEFINE 
        Ceq0  == [ [Ctrue] [pop [Cfalse]] ] dip i i. 
  </pre><pre data-v-f0d98270> Boole [C0] Ceq0 .

    Boole [C1] Ceq0 . 
  "No, no"

    Boole [[C0] Ceq0] [[[C2] Csucc] Ceq0] Cor. 
  "Yes, yes"
    Boole [[C0] Ceq0] [[[C2] Csucc] Ceq0] Cand. 
  "No, no"
  </pre>
  The Church truth values expect two quotations on the top of the stack,
  and depending on which truth value it is,
  one of the quotations will be discarded and the other will be executed.
  So they implement a simple version of branching.
  A more useful one would expect a third quotation on the stack
  that is executed to determine which of the other two is to be executed.
  The third quotation, the if-part,
  could be above of below the other two, the then-part and the else-part.
  For efficient execution the if-part should be on top,
  to be executed by the combinator i.
  On the other hand, for analogy with the ordinary combinator ifte,
  it is best if the if-part is the third element on the stack.
  In the following definition of a Church combinator Cifte,
  the if-part is moved to the top by rolling down the other two parts.
  Following that, the if-part is executed by the i combinator.

  Church truth values are actually very similar to
  the two operations which select one or the other from
  a pair of objects.
  The "dotted pair" constructor cons in Lisp and Scheme
  builds a pair of objects from its two parameters.
  The two operators car and cdr select the first or the second
  from such a pair.
  The last sentence just about captures the semantics of
  the constructor cons and the two operators.
  Any implementation must capture this semantic condition,
  but otherwise any further detail of the implementation is immaterial.
  <p data-v-f0d98270>
    The following define a constructor Ccons and
    two operators Ccar and Ccdr.
    The latter use the Church truth values Ctrue and Cfalse
    to effect the selection from a pair constructed by Ccons.
    Ccons of course expects two parameters on the top of the stack,
    but since there is no requirement that the two be wrapped into
    one parcel, it does not do so.
    Instead it just pushes the sligtly curious quotation [i].
    This will be executed by the call to the i combinator in
    Ccar and Ccdr, and that will result in either Ctrue or Cfalse
    being executed, depending on which one caused the execution of [i].
  <p data-v-f0d98270>
    Note that Ccons is more general than the cons operator on Joy
    which requires its topmost parameter to be a list.

    The definitions of Church concepts in Joy,

    are mainly of theoretical interest.
    So far none of the definitions have been found useful
    in practical programming in Joy.
    Accordingly none of the definitions have been included
    in any of the libraries.
    However, the Joy source for this note, without the text,
    is available on:

    There is also a vast literature available online,
    a web search for "Church numeral" will find many excellent expositions.
  <h1 data-v-f0d98270>Brent Kerby's elegant and efficient alternative Church numerals</h1><p data-v-f0d98270>
    Shortly after I put the preceding sections on the web page for Joy,
    on 9-Oct-2002 Brent Kerby sent a note to the "concatenative" mailing list.
    The remainder of this section is the first part of his note.
  <pre data-v-f0d98270>About the construction of Csucc (which adds one to a church number),

    Csucc ==  [dup [i] dip] dip i.

  this can be simplified a bit:

    Csucc ==  [dup dip] dip i.

  because "dup [i] dip" is the same as "dup dip"; by the way, the "dup dip"
  combinator is an interesting one; I call it "run", since it in effect
  executes a program without destroying the program.

  ----------
  Anyhow, onto the next construction:

    Cadd ==  [ [[Csucc] cons] ] dip i i;

  Here's an alternative:

    Cadd == [sip] dip i

  It works like this:

     [p] [m] [n] [sip] dip i
  == [p] [m] sip [n] i
  == [p] m [p] [n] i
  == [p] m [p] n

  ------------
  Next,

    Cmul ==  [ [[C0]] dip  [Cadd] cons [cons] cons ] dip i i;

  An alternative:

    Cmul == [cons] dip i

  It works like this:

     [p] [m] [n] [cons] dip i
  == [p] [m] cons [n] i
  == [[p] m] n

  -----------------
  Finally,

    Cpow ==  [ [[C1]] dip  [Cmul] cons [cons] cons ] dip i i.

  And, an alternative:

    Cpow == [[cons] cons] dip i i

  Working like this:

     [p] [m] [n] [[cons] cons] dip i i
  == [p] [m] [cons] cons n i
  == [p] [[m] cons] n i
  == [[[[[p] m] m] m] ...] i

  Unfortunately, in this system of church numbers, the Cpow is not a true
  combinator, only a pseudo-combinator (unlike Csucc, Cadd, and Cmul, which
  are true combinators).

  </pre><h1 data-v-f0d98270>Another kind of Church numeral, also by Brent Kerby</h1><p data-v-f0d98270>
    This section is verbatim the second part of his note.
  <pre data-v-f0d98270>  
  By the way, there are several other ways of doing church numbers in Joy. The
  current way assumes,

    [p] Cn  ==  p p ... p

  But alternatively we could do:

    [p] Rn  ==  p p ... p [p]

  The only difference here is that we save the original program "p". The
  principal advantage of this approach is that then Rn are reversible
  combinators (note, Cn were all irreversible combinators since they destroy
  the original program). We'd have,

    R0 ==
    R1 == run
    R2 == run run
    R3 == run run run
    ...

  This is quite an elegant setup, seeing that simply "run" acts as a successor
   function, and C0 is simply the empty program. Also, the negative church
  numbers then are

    R-1 == unrun
    R-2 == unrun unrun
    R-3 == unrun unrun unrun
    ...

  Note the reverse of any church number then is simply its negative. Also, to
  add church numbers is simply to concatenate them. Of course, "cat" itself is
  irreversible, so we might use "rat":

    [b] [a] rat ==  [b a] [a]

  This is a suitable addition function for the Rn church numbers; notice it
  preserves one of the parameters, like a reversible addition function should.
  Also, unlike Cadd, it does not execute the newly formed program (doing so
  would be irreversible, as "i" is irreversible).

  Here's how to multiply these Rn church numbers:

    Rmul == swap cons untack

  It works, for example, like this:

     [2] [3] swap cons untack
  == [[3] 2] untack
  == [3 3 [3]] untack
  == [3 3] [3]
  == [6] [3]

  So that's nice, except that this is not really reversible, since "cons" is
  not reversible (assuming we have transparent quotation; if we have opaque
  quotation then "cons" is reversible, but the multiplication then doesn't
  work because "untack" fails):

    [a] [dup] cons    == [[a] dup]  ==  [[a] [a]]
    [[a] [a]] [] cons == [[a] [a]]

  See how cons can give the same result from different inputs? This means it
  is irreversible.

  So can Rmul be defined from reversible primitives? If so, we would expect to
  fail in the case of multiplying by zero, since that is irreversible. Also,
  having a reversible Rmul would give us the ability to do division, and the
  ability to construct fractional church numbers. But do fractional church
  numbers make sense? For example, the church number for 1/2 would have the
  rule:

    [a a] R1/2  == a [a a]

  In a system with transparent quotation, it seems like R1/2 would not be
  straightforward to implement, perhaps impossible, since it would require the
  system to try to coerce an arbitrary "[p]" into the form "[a a]", by using
  reductions and expansions inside the quotation. But maybe there is some
  reasonable way to do it ...

  </pre><h1 data-v-f0d98270>Yet another kind of Church numeral, again by Brent Kerby</h1>
  Also on 9-Oct-2002 Brent wrote another note,
  which is reproduced her in full:
  <pre data-v-f0d98270>[ a propos my question: ]
  > Could you clarify why you say that your Cpow is not a true combinator?

  Well, it's pretty simple, really. When we try to write a "reduction rule"
  for Cpow, the best we can get is this:

    [p] [m] [n] Cpow  ==  [p] [[m] cons] n i

  Note the appearances of "cons" and "i" on the right hand side. This is in
  essence what makes it a pseudo-combinator. A true combinator has a reduction
  rule without such things on its right hand side, for example:

          [a] dup   == [a] [a]
      [b] [a] swap  == [a] [b]
      [p] [n] Csucc == p [p] n
  [p] [m] [n] Cadd  == [p] m [p] n
  [p] [m] [n] Cmul  == [[p] m] n

  See how in all of these the right hand side consists solely of variables,
  mixed up through concatenation and quotation. That is why they are called
  true combinators, because they possess a reduction rule of this kind.

  For the curious, there is some interest in a system that contains only true
  combinators, no pseudo-combinators. Such a system would have to get rid of
  quotation, since the quotation of any combinator is a pseudo-combinator
  (e.g., "[dup]" or "[swap]" is a pseudo-combinator, since it possesses no
  reduction rule). This idea hasn't been fully explored, but you might like to
  look back on the post
  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/concatenative/message/1051 and other posts
  thereabouts. The idea is that a workable base is {nil, zap, dup, i, unit,
  take, cat}:

           nil  == []
       [a] zap  ==
       [a] dup  == [a] [a]
       [a] i    == a
       [a] unit == [[a]]
   [b] [a] take == [a [b]]
   [b] [a] cat  == [b a]

  I suspect that all true combinators can be constructed form these, using
  concatenation alone (no quotations allowed), and there is very probably a
  smaller base that will work. Here's a few examples of some constructions in
  this system (a searcher reveals that these are the minimal constructions):

    dip  == take i
    swap == unit take i
    flip == unit take take i  (i.e., a combinator that reverses the top 3
  items)
    dupd == unit take i unit dup cat take i
         == unit take i dup unit take take i
    sip  == unit take i unit dup cat take i take i
         == unit take i dup unit take take i take i

  More simply, we could have

    dupd == swap dup flip
    sip  == dupd dip

  Yes, in the classical combinatory logic you can exponentiate Church numbers
  simply by applying them (although it is the base that is applied to the
  exponent, not the other way around). We can do the same thing in Joy if we
  reform the Church numbers once more (I'll call them Zn, as that is what the
  Church numbers are standardly called):

    [x] [p] Zn  ==  [[[[[x] p] p] ...] p

  For example,

    [x] [p] Z0  == x
    [x] [p] Z1  == [x] p
    [x] [p] Z2  == [[x] p] p

  Note these Church numbers take two parameters as opposed to the one
  parametered Cn and Rn. Anyhow, we can define the operators then in this way:

       [x] [p] [n] Zsucc ==  [[x] [p] n] p
   [x] [p] [n] [m] Zadd  ==  [[x] [p] n] [p] m
   [x] [p] [n] [m] Zmul  ==  [x] [[p] n] m
   [x] [p] [n] [m] Zpow  ==  [x] [p] [n] m

  Or by construction,

    Zsucc  == [B] S
    Zadd   == [B] N
    Zmul   == B
    Zpow   == i

  where B, S, and N are the classical combinators

      [c] [b] [a] B == [[c] b] a
      [c] [b] [a] S == [[c] b] [c] a
  [d] [c] [b] [a] N == [[d] c] [[d] b] a

  See how neat that works, with Zpow being simply "i".

  Anyhow, these Zn seem to be the true analogue of the classical Church
  numbers, although that's not to say that they are necessarily the most
  appropriate in a concatenative system. But, Zn do have use; for example,

    dip2 == [dip] Z2
    dip3 == [dip] Z3
    dip4 == [dip] Z4
    ...

  See,

     [p] dip3
  == [p] [dip] Z3
  == [[[p] dip] dip] dip

  That seems pretty handy.
